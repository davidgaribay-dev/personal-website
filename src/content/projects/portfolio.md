A modern, performant portfolio website built with Astro v5 and Tailwind CSS v4, designed to showcase professional experience, projects, and recommendations. The site leverages Astro's server-side rendering capabilities for optimal performance and SEO.

Built with a content-driven architecture using markdown-based collections for experience entries, project showcases, blog notes, and professional recommendations. Each content type uses YAML frontmatter for structured metadata, making content management simple and maintainable.

The project demonstrates modern web development practices including TypeScript for type safety, responsive design principles, and performance optimization through Astro's partial hydration. Deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from the main branch.

The codebase is MIT licensed and serves as both a live professional portfolio and an open-source template that others can fork and customize for their own use.
