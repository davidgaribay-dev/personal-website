AI doesn't replace critical thinking, it accelerates it.

After 7+ years in the software industry and months of deep diving into Agentic AI and Context Engineering, I wanted to share what I've learned.

In this video, I walk through a complete Agentic AI platform I built from the ground up using a Native-AI approach featuring real-time streaming chat with LangGraph agents, MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool integration, semantic memory and embeddings (RAG) with pgvector, hierarchical multi-tenancy (Organizations → Teams → Users), and enterprise integrations for secrets management, audit logging, guardrails, localization, and LLM observability.

I'll be sharing the agents, hooks, MCP Servers, and the mental model I used to build this, plus diving into Proxmox and scaling strategies in follow up videos.

For those just starting their AI journey, I'll also be releasing beginner-focused content covering what I wish I knew when I started.
