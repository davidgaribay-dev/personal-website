A specialized marketplace of Claude Code plugins designed to enhance Git workflows and boost developer productivity. This curated collection addresses gaps in developer tooling with a focus on standardization and best practices.

Featured plugins include:

**git-commit-push Command:**
- Interactive Git workflow with built-in approval gates
- Automatic generation of conventional commit messages
- Safe review process before pushing to remote repositories
- Industry-standard commit formatting

**Worktree Skill:**
- Enables parallel development through Git worktrees
- Allows multiple Claude Code sessions to run simultaneously on different features
- Standardized directory structure for organized multi-branch work

The marketplace emphasizes minimal, granular installation - developers can install only the specific plugins they need without unnecessary bloat. All plugins are MIT licensed and designed with Git-focused specialization and developer-centric workflows in mind.
