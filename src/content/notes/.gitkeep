# Notes Content

This directory contains notes in Markdown format.

## Creating a New Note

1. Create a new `.md` file with a descriptive slug (e.g., `my-first-note.md`)
2. Add frontmatter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Note Title"
description: "A brief summary of your note"
publishDate: 2024-12-08
updatedDate: 2024-12-09  # Optional
tags: ["testing", "automation"]
draft: false  # Set to true to hide from production
featured: false  # Set to true to highlight on the main page
---

Your content here...
```

## Tips

- Use `draft: true` while writing to prevent it from showing in production
- Use `featured: true` for your best notes to highlight them
- Tags are used for filtering and categorization
- The slug becomes the URL (e.g., `my-first-note.md` → `/notes/my-first-note`)
