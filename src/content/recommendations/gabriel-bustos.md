As a Product Manager for our company's primary product, our features must function to the best of our abilities without incident in production. Our QA person is our last line of defense to ensure proper steps are taken to prevent a disruption in our customer's workflow. David had demonstrated immense discipline in asking clarifying questions on product requirements before and after development and caught many issues before being released. I was so thankful to have David's experience on my team, who takes the time to really understand the product and use cases and enforce quality assurance in our software. David is highly recommended to anyone who values quality features and would be a significant asset to any company lucky enough to have him.
