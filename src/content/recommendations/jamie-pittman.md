I had the pleasure of working with David, and I was thoroughly impressed with his abilities and work ethic. I consider myself to be a pretty thorough engineer, but David always asked great questions and brought to light situations that were not previously considered. David was very involved in the development process from start to finish. He participated in our UX and Design sessions, posing questions and thinking through how the feature would be tested. David reviewed PRs from the frontend and backend teams as he has knowledge of both JavaScript and Python. I highly recommend David and think he would be an asset to any organization!
