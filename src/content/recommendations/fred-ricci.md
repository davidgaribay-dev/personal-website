I worked with David for almost a year on the Test Automation team at Nuna Inc, and he was a great teammate. He demonstrated a high proficiency in writing automated tests using TypeScript/JavaScript and Playwright. He also went above and beyond to ensure the tests ran efficiently in CI/CD with proper reporting and failure notifications. I also really appreciated the fact that he always wrote clear and concise documentation around test automation best practices, team best practices, test execution guides, etc. Overall, I would recommend David for a test automation role.
