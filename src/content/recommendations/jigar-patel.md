I highly recommend David for the role of Sr. SDET. I had the pleasure of working with him at Nuna, where he worked as part of my QA automation group. David consistently delivered high-quality work, possessed excellent skills in problem-solving, and interacted effectively with cross-functional teams. He has a solid technical background, keeps up with technological advances, and has an energetic work ethic. Any organization would benefit from having David on board.
